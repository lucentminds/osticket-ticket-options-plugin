# osticket-ticket-options-plugin
Adds handy features and tweaks to the staff interface.

* Enables the ability to move the ticket details ( dept, source, topic, 
   user etc... ) to another tab so you can focus on the main thread.

* Enables the ability to view the latest ticket activity above older activites
   and the reply form on top.

* Enables agent collaborator comment/reply e-mails to be received and contain
   links formatted for agents and not for normal users. This allows the ability
   for other agents to watch a ticket or to "assign" multiple agents to one
   ticket.

* Enables wide tables of ticket queues for viewing more columns.

## Todo

* Add options/flags for indivdual agents preferences.
